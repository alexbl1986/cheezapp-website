                <p><strong>Your privacy matters.</strong> Cheez is designed with privacy at its core. All photo processing happens on your device, and your photos never leave your phone unless you choose to share them.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cheez ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, we collect your email address, name, and authentication credentials (password or third-party auth tokens for Google/Apple Sign-In).</li>
                <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> We store your preferences including quality threshold settings and tutorial completion status.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> If you contact us at support@cheezapp.top, we collect your email address and message content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera Data:</strong> The App accesses your device camera to capture photos and perform real-time face detection. All processing happens on your device using Apple's Vision framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Storage:</strong> Selfies you capture are stored locally on your device. We do not upload your photos to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Face Detection Data:</strong> The App analyzes facial landmarks (19+ detection points) to provide quality scoring and guidance. This analysis happens on-device in real-time and is not stored or transmitted.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous analytics data including app launches, feature usage, tutorial completion, and crash reports to improve the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device type, iOS version, and app version for compatibility and support purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Subscription and Payment Information</h3>
            <p>Subscription purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple provides us with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subscription status (active, expired, cancelled)</li>
                <li>Subscription type (weekly or yearly)</li>
                <li>Purchase and renewal dates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provide Core Features:</strong> Camera access and face detection enable real-time selfie guidance and auto-capture functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Analysis:</strong> Facial landmark detection and image analysis provide quality scores and improvement tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> Authentication services (Firebase Auth) enable cloud sync of your settings and preferences across devices.</li>
                <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Analytics help us understand feature usage and identify bugs or performance issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We use your email to respond to support requests and provide assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> We verify subscription status to provide premium features to paying users.</li>
            </ul>
